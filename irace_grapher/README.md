# Get the code 

This is a standalone folder, so there's no need to clone the entire repo (though you can if you want).

# Getting started

Depends on Python3. The pip packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` files.

```bash 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then 

```bash 
python3 graph.py
```
